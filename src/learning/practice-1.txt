//ng For directive

we render html 
//in ts file
public colors = ["red","blue","green","yellow"];

//in html file
<div *ngFor = "let color of colors; index as i">
    <h2>{{i}} {{color}}</h2>
</div>

//Component Interaction
sharing data from parent to child -> use @Input()
and from child to parent -> use @Output()

we will send name from app Component to testComponent and  in child component we will write "Hello Priyanshi".
testComponent will return message  "Hey Codevolution" to the parent .

agar koi value parent se lenge toh ham child m uske aage input decorator likh denge..
